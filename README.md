# twitter_map_lab

This repo consists of 2 direcctories for 2 lab tasks: 2_2 and 2_3.

lab2_2 is a json analyzer which allows to go through the levels in the json file and access the values of keys.

lab2_3 iss a web app that finds locations of users that a particular user is following. Then, an html page with a Folium map and markers on locations of users is shown.

Twitter API v2 is used to solve this task. Also, I limited the number of markers to 60 so that the program does not work for too long. The main user's location, if available and not overshadowed by any other marker, can be seen in blue color.
